# Taolingo

Our program is designed by top American teachers to make sure students learn the "lingo" not just the language. 
All language is art and we make the learning experience fun while also teaching the artistic expression so you sound like a native speaker.
We have been teaching for over 20 years and have state of the art partnerships with Microsoft for a great learning experience.

We focus on the key aspects of linguistics to turn you not only into a speaker, but a master poet who has confidence in your communication skills.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Tools/IDE:
1. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code <small>(Preferred)</small></a> or any another IDE to make changes into the code.
2. Git should be installed in the system.

Languages/Technologies used in the project:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. JQuery

### Installation:
#### Direct Download
1. Download <a href="https://github.com/TaoFruit/taofruit/archive/gh-pages.zip" target="_blank">Taolingo.zip</a>
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Open the folder in <b>VS Code</b> or any other <b>Code Editor</b>.

### For developers using git
1. First, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo"><b>Fork</b></a> this repo.

2. Clone the forked repo locally:
    ```sh
    $ git clone {your_forked_repo_url }
    $ cd {folder_name}
    ```
    **Note: Current branch should be gh-pages. To check the current branch type following in git bash**
    ```sh
    $ git branch
    ```
    <b>To change the branch to gh-pages.</b>

    ```sh
    $ git checkout gh-pages
    ```
3. Now, type `npm-install` in command line to install the required node modules:
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```
4.  Once node modules installed then open the code in editor, 
    If using <b>VS Code</b> project can be opened directly using command line:
    ```sh
    $ code .
    ```
    Else open the project in your code editor.
    **Note: Always make a new branch before making changes.**

  ### Development server

  Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

  ### Code scaffolding

  Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

  ### Build

  Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

  ### Running unit tests

  Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

  ### Running end-to-end tests

  Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

  ### Further help

  To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
